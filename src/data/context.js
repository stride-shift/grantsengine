══ ALUMNI STORIES (use these real stories in proposals — do NOT fabricate) ══

SIPHUMEZO ADAM — Pilot 2022, KwaLanga, Cape Town → ABSA CIB internship (New Digital team) → Now d-lab staff (Cohort Coordinator). Presented at Motus and Standard Bank offices despite crippling anxiety. Overcame imposter syndrome as a "university dropout from KwaLanga." The ultimate proof of model — beneficiary becomes builder.
Quote: "Empowerment is not a handover. It is a continuous negotiation between opportunity and support, courage and fear, readiness and reality."

SIMANYE MDUNYELWA — 2024, Inkcubeko (George) → 3-month internship → 12-month Technolab Intern → Now ECD Facilitator shaping young learners' lives. Shows the multiplier effect — graduate now develops others.
Quote: "d-lab not only teaches technical skills but also builds confidence, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities that can open unexpected career opportunities."

PRIESKA MOFOKENG — 2025, Penreach (Mpumalanga) → Arrived nervous and overwhelmed → Now running her own poster and flyer design business. Shows programme works beyond formal employment — entrepreneurship in a rural province.
Quote: "d-lab didn't just teach me how to use tools; it taught me how to think differently, how to solve problems, how to create with purpose, and how to believe in my own ideas."

SCI-BONO GRADUATE — 2025, Sci-Bono Discovery Centre → ICITP Computer End User certified → Multimedia studio internship → IT Department internship. Shows accreditation pathway and hands-on technical development.

EMPLOYER TESTIMONIAL — Michelle Adler, forgood: "I had the pleasure of working with several talented interns from d-lab... They consistently demonstrated professionalism beyond their years. Their work ethic stood out — they approached every task with diligence, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn. Highly recommended!"

50 alumni have completed microjobbing contracts. Graduates placed at ABSA CIB, forgood, Technolab, Sci-Bono, StrideShift.AI, Maxtec, EQ-FIN, ITEC Tiyende, and others.

══ KEY LESSONS (from delivery experience) ══
- Programmes without stipends = higher churn (learned from Penreach 2025)
- FET entrants have substantial work-readiness gaps in digital and financial literacy
- Employers now expect baseline coding competence + AI tool proficiency
- The core problem d-lab solves: "the conversion gap between qualification and employability"
- d-lab's trajectory: "from pilot to proof" — not expansion, but system embedding

TONE GUIDANCE: Write proposals that are warm, human, and compelling — not dry or bureaucratic. Lead with the human story and real impact. Show passion for the work. Use specific numbers to build credibility but weave them into narrative. When addressing a returning funder, acknowledge the existing relationship warmly and show what their previous support helped achieve. Be conversational but professional. When describing d-lab's growth and trajectory, ALWAYS emphasise the SYSTEM — 8 programme types, partner delivery model, in-house AI tools, diversified revenue, exceptional outcomes. NEVER lead with geographic expansion or province-counting. Geography is where the work happens, not why it matters. The story is: we built a system that works, and it can work anywhere.

PROPOSAL STRATEGY: Match the programme type to the funder. Small foundations (R200K-R600K): offer a partner-funded cohort (R516K) or Sci-Bono-style short course (R232K). Medium foundations/CSI (R600K-R1.5M): offer a cohort with stipends (R1.236M) or FET programme (R1.079M). Large funders (R1.5M+): offer d-lab-funded cohort (R1.597M) or multi-cohort packages. SETAs: multi-cohort national programmes. Corporate: Type 5 short-format (R651K) or Type 8 bespoke leadership accelerator (from R2.75M) with B-BBEE value. Always include organisational cost contribution (30%) for sustainability.`;
