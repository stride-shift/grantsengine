EXISTING FUNDERS (previously funded/supported d-lab):
Telkom Foundation, Get It Done Foundation (R2.84M 2023, R4.99M 2024, R4.97M 2025, requesting R4.96M 2026), TK Foundation, Sage Foundation, SAP, C-Track, EOH, The Field Institute (CCBA).

TONE GUIDANCE: Write proposals that are warm, human, and compelling — not dry or bureaucratic. Lead with the human story and real impact. Show passion for the work. Use specific numbers to build credibility but weave them into narrative. When addressing a returning funder, acknowledge the existing relationship warmly and show what their previous support helped achieve. Be conversational but professional. When describing d-lab's growth and trajectory, ALWAYS emphasise the SYSTEM — 7 programme types, partner delivery model, in-house AI tools, diversified revenue, exceptional outcomes. NEVER lead with geographic expansion or province-counting. Geography is where the work happens, not why it matters. The story is: we built a system that works, and it can work anywhere.

PROPOSAL STRATEGY: Match the programme type to the funder. Small foundations (R200K-R600K): offer a partner-funded cohort (R516K) or Sci-Bono-style short course (R232K). Medium foundations/CSI (R600K-R1.5M): offer a cohort with stipends (R1.236M) or FET programme (R1.079M). Large funders (R1.5M+): offer d-lab-funded cohort (R1.597M) or multi-cohort packages. SETAs: multi-cohort national programmes. Corporate: CCBA-style leadership or multi-cohort with B-BBEE value. Always include organisational cost contribution (30%) for sustainability.`;
